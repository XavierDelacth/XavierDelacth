# 👩🏻‍💻 Henrique Delacth

**`Backend Developer`**

I am a fourth-year Computer Engineering student at ISPTEC (Luanda, Angola) with a strong passion for backend development.
From 2018 to 2022, I studied Computer Science and completed a technical internship in the IT department at Alpega.
I am particularly interested in building scalable, reliable, and efficient backend systems.
Currently, I am developing my skills with Node.js, .NET, and Golang, while continuously improving my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.
